                <h1>Hello,<br>I'm<span> KC Liwanag.</span></h1>
                <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how design delivers a unique purpose – shaping the way we think and feel. Being a UX/ UI designer, I can craft empathy-driven designs and user-centred solutions. I enjoy combining my creative problem-solving skills with visual communication and storytelling. I’m driven by a mission to improve usability whilst being able to delight.<br><br>
                As a student of BCIT’s New Media Design and Web Development program – graduating March 2022, I’m expanding my technical and creative skillsets as a UX/UI and visual designer. I’m passionate about producing work that establishes value, meaning and a connection with an audience. Seeking new experiences and learning from diverse perspectives continues to ignite my creative spark as well as curiosity in life.</p>
